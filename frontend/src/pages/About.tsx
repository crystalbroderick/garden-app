        Balcony Botany mainly helps city dwellers and/or people with small
        patios for growing their own fresh veggies, herbs, and fruit in
        containers.

        Produce kept getting more expensive and I grew (pun intended) tired of
        searching for gardening tips throughout MANY sites full of filler
        information that wasn't tailored to my specific needs. I just wanted
        basic gardening tips for common vegetables and reminders on how to take
        care of my plants. Hope this app helps others users as well :)
